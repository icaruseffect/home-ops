    Node-RED is a browser-based programming tool that allows you to wire together hardware devices, APIs, and online services in new and interesting ways.
    The tool provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using a wide range of nodes.
    Flows can be created using a rich text editor, and JavaScript functions can be created within the editor.
    A built-in library allows you to save useful functions, templates, or flows for re-use.
    The light-weight runtime is built on Node.js, taking full advantage of its event-driven, non-blocking model
